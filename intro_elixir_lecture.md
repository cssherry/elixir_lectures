Erlang ("Ericsson language") is a component of Ericsson, which has about a 35 percent global market share in the wireless network infrastructure.

Elixir was created by JosÃ© Valim, a Rails core team member, in 2011.

## Simple Demos

Note:

lists are stored in memory as linked lists; prepending elements is O(1) but finding the length is O(n).

because data types are immutable in elixir, the original tuple isn't changed.

tuples are stored contiguously in memory; finding the length is O(1) but changing elements is O(n) because it requires copying the tuple's entire contents to a new tuple.

(you can use the `^` operator to pattern match against a variable's value:)

if you don't care about a value in a pattern, you can use `_` to fill that space.

you can compile modules using the `elixirc` command in the terminal (e.g., `elixirc math.ex`)

you can also compile and run `.exs` files without creating a `.beam` file like so: `elixir math.exs`

inside modules, `def` creates public functions while `defp` creates private functions

functions can have guards

no `for` loops in elixir - only recursion!

but in general, use the `Enum` module, which has most of the normal functions in it (`reduce`, `map`, &c.)

`Enumerable` is similar to ruby's: the functions work with any data type that implements its protocol.

you can pipe the results of a function directly into another function using `|>`
