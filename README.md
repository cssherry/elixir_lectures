This repo holds my notes to prepare for an Elixir workshop.

The intro_elixir_lecture covers the basics of Elixir; intro_elixir_notes
provides much more excessively detailed background information for that
lecture.

The intro_phoenix_lecture covers the Phoenix framework, comparing it mostly to
Rails.

The phoenix_chat_demo has instructions on how to create a chat app with
Phoenix. It is a simplified version of the instructions available on
phoenixframework.org
