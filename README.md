This repo holds lecture notes for an Elixir workshop.

The intro_elixir_lecture covers the basics of Elixir in way too much depth.

The intro_phoenix_lecture covers the Phoenix framework, comparing it mostly to
Rails.

The phoenix_chat_demo has instructions on how to create a chat app with
Phoenix. It is a simplified version of the instructions available on
phoenixframework.org
